## Description
This Github repository contains some of my programming work.Most of them are Python programsüêç.They are very small programs.There are comments (Chinese) in the python program code to facilitate writing program.Feel free to explore the scripts and use them for your learning and automation needs!

I'm not a professional programmer, just an amateur. I create these programs purely for fun. Due to my busy schedule, I don't have much time to continue learning and writing programs.
